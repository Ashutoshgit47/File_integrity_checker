## 🔐 File Integrity Verification Tool


The File Integrity Verification Tool is a simple yet powerful desktop application built with Python and Tkinter. It allows users to:
Generate cryptographic hash values (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512) for any file.
Verify the integrity of a file by comparing hash values.
Detect if a file has been altered or tampered with.
This tool is ideal for cybersecurity students, forensic analysts, and developers who want to ensure file authenticity.
